In this project, I've developed the A* algorithm from the ground up and showcased its functionality on a dynamic website. The website features an interactive visualization of the A* algorithm, allowing users to observe real-time pathfinding. Parameters can be customized, enabling users to explore the algorithm's responsiveness. Additionally, the website provides educational resources, including tutorials and articles, to enhance understanding and application of the A* algorithm.
